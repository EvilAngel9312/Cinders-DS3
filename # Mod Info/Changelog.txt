 - Added new dark themed moves instead of the miracles the Cathedral Knight has
  - Vow of Agony
  - Affinity
  - Dark Blade weapon buff
- Increased Vordt's absorptions.
- Increased Sister Friede's poise to 30. This is to make it harder to stun-lock her from a distance, whilst allowing most normal weapons to stun her as normal.
- Reduced duration of Furious Lizard projectile attack.
- Removed Furious Lizards boss.
- Reduced the damage of the Twisted Knight occult energies spell.
- Added the Herald of Winter (Millwood Knight with Velstadt skin) and Enraged Greatwolf in the Depths of the Painting.

  - Sacred Chime Hammer
  - Rampart Golem Lance
  - Wretched Pendant

 - The Colossus will remain inactive until both the Frostfire Clerics are killed
 - Colossus is now immune to damage until both the Frostfire Clerics are killed.
 - Odessa's Crystal now boosts Fire absorption by 25% if possessed while in the Frostfire Colossus fight.
 - Frozen Chaos Essence now prevents Frostbite if possessed while in the Frostfire Colossus fight.
 - Reduced the poise and stamina damage of several of the Frostfire Colossus attacks to more reasonable levels.
 - Adjusted the stagger types on various Frostfire Colossus attacks so fewer attacks cause punitive staggering.
 - Disabled the Blizzard VFX during the Frostfire Colossus fight due to excessive FPS loss and reduced readability it causes.
 - Reduced the HP regen to 5 per second while it is active.
 - Changed the regular spinning orb attack into a frostfire breath attack instead.
 - Moved the sapping orb spawn location close to the floor so it isn't unfair to melee players.
 - Made the sapping aura less punitive.
 
# Enemies
- Reduced the drop rate of gems from Red Crystal Lizards.
- Added 'fake' poise system for hostile NPCs that simulates the normal poise system enemies have. Each NPC can take either 1, 3 or 5 hits within 7 seconds, after which they will always stagger on subsequent hits until the hit timer expires.
- Removed the small Red Crystal Lizards.
- Made the big Red Crystal Lizard a normal enemy: found in Irithyll Dungeon, Profaned Capital, Consumed King's Garden, Lothric Castle and Grand Archives.

# Weapons
- Hex catalysts now cast all schools. This should prevent the left-hand spell buff issue.
- Changed Repeating Pistol so it is now a faster version of the Hunter's Pistol, but slightly weaker per shot.
- Reduced the stamina and poise damage of the pistols heavily.
- Increased the FP cost of sidearms slightly.

# Infusions
